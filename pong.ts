  // Inside this function you will use the classes and functions 
  // defined in svgelement.ts and observable.ts
  // to add visuals to the svg element in pong.html, animate them, and make them interactive.
  // Study and complete the tasks in basicexamples.ts first to get ideas.

  // You will be marked on your functional programming style
  // as well as the functionality that you implement.
  // Document your code!  
  // Explain which ideas you have used ideas from the lectures to 
  // create reusable, generic functions.
